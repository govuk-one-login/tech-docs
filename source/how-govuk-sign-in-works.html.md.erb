# How GOV.UK Sign in works

GOV.UK Sign in is an [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/)-compliant service that helps you authenticate your users who are using their GOV.UK Account.

1. Your user selects the button to sign in for your service, which sends an authorisation request to GOV.UK Sign in.
1. GOV.UK Sign in’s `/authorize` endpoint redirects your user and prompts them to sign in.
1. Your user uses one of the sign in options to authenticate themselves.
1. Your user may see terms and conditions and also some consent information about which data items GOV.UK Sign in shares with your service.
1. GOV.UK Sign in redirects your user back to your service, along with an authorisation code tagged onto the end of the URL.
1. Your service calls the `/token` endpoint with the user’s authorisation code and using a [private_key_jwt](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication) as the client authentication method.
1. GOV.UK Sign in verifies the information your service has passed in the token request. If the verification is successful, your service will receive an ID token and an access token.
1. Your service can use the access token to make a call to the `/userinfo` endpoint to request basic user information such as the user’s unique identifier (UUID).
1. Your service has now authenticated your user and they can continue their journey.

## Understand the environments GOV.UK Sign in uses

GOV.UK Sign in uses 2 different environments:

* a sandbox environment, which contains sample users and data for you to test your service’s integration with GOV.UK Sign in
* a production environment, which is the live environment for real users to access and use your service’s integration with GOV.UK Sign in

### Understand and use the sandbox environment

Before you can use GOV.UK Sign in, you need to build a proof of concept client and explore the end-to-end journey in our sandbox environment. This will help you understand how to integrate with GOV.UK Sign in, and where it will fit within your service.

1. [Generate a key pair](/generate-a-key/#generate-a-key-pair).
1. [Select supported scopes](/select-supported-scopes/#select-supported-scopes).
1. [Manage your service to use the OpenID Connect provider](/manage-your-service-to-use-OIDC-provider/#manage-your-service-to-use-the-openid-connect-provider).
1. [Integrate with Authorization Code Flow](/integrate-with-code-flow/#integrate-with-authorization-code-flow).

To get started, you’ll need to [generate a key pair](/generate-a-key/#generate-a-key-pair).
