# Quick start

Using this page is optional but can be helpful to see how a typical integration with GOV.UK One Login works. 

You'll create an example service using either a local copy of the GOV.UK One Login simulator or the GOV.UK One Login integration environment. 

You'll be able to test authentication-only or authentication and identity journeys, and see the responses from these endpoints:

* `/.well-known/openid-configuration`
* `/.well-known/jwks.json`
* `/.well-known/did.json`
* `/trustmark`
* `/authorize`
* `/userinfo`
* `/token`
* `/logout` 

You have 3 different options to create an example service, depending on your needs and how much code you want to view.

| Method to run the example service                         | Approximate time | Result                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| With the GOV.UK One Login simulator using Docker Compose. | 3 minutes        | You'll see the simulated response from GOV.UK One Login without viewing additional code. |
| With the GOV.UK One Login simulator using source code.    | 10 minutes       | You'll see the simulated response from GOV.UK One Login and view additional code.        |
| Using the GOV.UK One Login integration environment.       | 15 minutes       | You can use test user data to interact with the integration environment.                 |

## Prerequisites

1. If you do not already have it, [install git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git). 
1. If you do not already have it, [install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) (you'll use this to run the simulator).
1. [Check you are on v4.34 or higher for Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-check-docker-version/). 
1. [Enable Docker Host networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/host/#docker-desktop).  
1. [Install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). 
    
## Run the example service with the GOV.UK One Login simulator using Docker Compose
 
1. On the command line, run `git clone https://github.com/govuk-one-login/onboarding-examples && cd onboarding-examples/clients/nodejs`. This will get the example Typescript code and set your working directory.
1. On the command line, run `docker compose up`.
1. Open `http://localhost:8080`. 
1. Select **Make a request for authentication**. 
1. If you want to run an identity journey, select **Make a request for authentication and identity**. 
1. Select the **Sign out** link in the top header.

## Run the example service with the GOV.UK One Login simulator using source code

1. On the command line, run `git clone https://github.com/govuk-one-login/onboarding-examples && cd onboarding-examples/clients/nodejs`. This will get the example Typescript code and set your working directory.
1. Run `nvm install 22.11.0 && nvm use 22.11.0`. This makes sure you're using the correct version of Node.js. 
1. Run `npm run simulator:start` to start the simulator in a Docker container.
1. Check the simulator is working by running `npm run simulator:config`. You should see the simulator configuration appear. 
1. Run `npm ci && npm run dev:sim` to build and run the example.
1. View the example service by going to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
1. Select **Start by logging in**.
1. You should see the response from the `/userinfo` and `/token` endpoints: ID and access tokens and user attributes. 
1. If you want to run an identity journey, select **Verify** again and you should see a successful identity response including the `coreIdentityJWT`, `returnCode` (empty), `address` claims. 
1. Select **Sign out** in the top header.
1. You'll see a page which says **Logged out**. 

## Run the example service using the GOV.UK One Login integration environment   

Before you start, make sure you have a: 

* [recognised government email address](https://admin.sign-in.service.gov.uk/register/enter-email-address) 
* UK mobile phone with a number starting `07` or `+44` 

### Run an authentication journey using the GOV.UK One Login integration environment

#### Configure the integration environment

1. On the command line, run `git clone https://github.com/gov-uk-one-login/onboarding-examples && cd onboarding-examples/clients/nodejs`. This will get the example Typescript code and set your working directory.
1. Run `nvm install 22.11.0 && nvm use 22.11.0`. This makes sure you're using the correct version of Node.js. 
1. Run `npm run generatekeys`. This generates a key pair if one does not exist yet. 
1. Launch the [GOV.UK One Login admin tool](https://admin.sign-in.service.gov.uk/register/enter-email-address).
1. Follow on-screen instructions to [register and manage your service](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/before-integrating/register-and-manage-your-service/) in the integration environment.
1. Configure your service name or names as `onboarding-example - {DEPARTMENT} - {SERVICE_TEAM_NAME}`
1. Find your `Client ID` value and make a record of it. You'll need this later when configuring the example application.
1. Configure your service including (at a minimum): 
    * a redirect URI: `http://localhost:8080/oidc/authorization-code/callback`
    * a public key (copy the static public key you created earlier from the `./public_key.pem` file, excluding the headers)
    * scopes: `openid`, `email`, `phone`
    * a post logout redirect URI: `http://localhost:8080/oidc/logged-out`
    * there's further [guidance on registering and managing your service](/before-integrating/register-and-manage-your-service/#register-and-manage-your-service) if you want to include additional fields

#### Configure the example application 
 
1. Create a `.env.integration` configuration file by copying the `.env.integration.example` file to `.env.integration`. 
1. Edit `.env.integration` in your preferred source editor and update:
    * the `{CLIENT_ID}` placeholder to contain the Client ID from the GOV.UK One Login admin tool
    * the `{PRIVATE_KEY}` placeholder with the contents of the `./private_key.pem` file you created earlier (excluding the headers)

#### Start the example application and follow the journey

1. Run `npm ci && npm run dev:int` – this installs the dependencies and runs the application. 
1. View the example service by going to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
1. Select **Start by logging in**.
1. Follow the on-screen instructions to create a GOV.UK One Login. 
1. You should see the response from the `/userinfo` and `/token` endpoints: ID and access tokens and user attributes. 

If you want to run an authentication-only journey, you can stop here. 

### Run an authentication and identity journey using the GOV.UK One Login integration environment

If you want to run an authentication and identity journey, you should do the following additional steps as well as the steps above. 

1. Update your client configuration in the integration environment using the [GOV.UK One Login admin tool](https://admin.sign-in.service.gov.uk/register/enter-email-address):
    * set **Prove user’s identities** to **Yes**
    * set the claims to `coreIdentityJWT`, `returnCode` and  `address`
1. [Follow the guidance to test a successful identity proving journey](/test-your-integration/using-integration-for-testing/#test-a-successful-identity-proving-journey), starting at step 3.
1. You need to request fictional users and their knowledge-based verification (KBV) answers to help you test your journeys. [Contact GOV.UK One Login](mailto:govuk-one-login@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) to access this test user data.
1. Using this test user data, you should see a successful identity response including the `coreIdentityJWT`, `returnCode` (empty), `address` claims. If you do not, [get in touch](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/support/).

If you have any issues:
