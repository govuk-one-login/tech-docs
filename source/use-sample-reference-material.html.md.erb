# Use sample reference material

You can use sample reference material to see an example of how to use Authorization Code Flow.

<%= warning_text('You should not use the sample reference material in the production environment.') %>

We recommend you [use a certified OIDC client library](https://openid.net/developers/certified/) rather than building your own.

## View Java sample reference material

You can [refer to the sample reference material if you’re using Java to integrate your service to use GOV.UK One Login](https://github.com/alphagov/di-auth-stub-relying-party).
