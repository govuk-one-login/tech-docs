# OAuth Token Endpoint

The GOV.UK One Login Signal Exchange uses the [OAuth2 Client Credentials Grant][external.oauth-client-credentials-flow] to authenticate between GOV.UK One Login Signal Exchange transmitter and your receiver when sending signals.

The GOV.UK One Login Transmitter will initiate the client credentials flow by making this API request:  

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://YOUR.SERVICE.gov.uk/oauth2/token \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data client_id=CLIENT_ID \
  --data client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET \
  --data grant_type=client_credentials
```
The expected response should look like the following:

```json
{
  "access_token": "ACCESS_TOKEN",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 14400,
  "scope": "hello"
}
```

## Token Endpoint behaviour

There are certain assumptions that we make about your endpoint. These are:

* Validity of `access_token`:
    * GOV.UK One Login Signal Exchange Transmitter must be able to request a new token without invalidating previously issued tokens.
    * The token must be valid for a minimum of 1 hour.
* Throughput:
    * The `/token` endpoint will need to be able to support a [high throughput][ssfOut.signal-delivery].

The token endpoint will then be used authenticate against the [receiver endpoint][ssfOut.receiver] which you must set up next.
