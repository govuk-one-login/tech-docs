# View Your configuration

The GOV.UK One Login Signals Exchange Transmitter API uses the [Stream Endpoint][external.ssfOut-stream-read-endpoint] as a way to view the configuration of the integration.

In order to view your configuration, you must first authenticate against the GOV.UK One Login Transmitter OAuth token endpoint:

<%= partial "partials/ssf_out_transmitter-token-endpoint" %>

Once you've obtained an `ACCESS_TOKEN`, you can make the following request to view your configuration: 

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url STREAM_ENDPOINT \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
```

Below are the stream endpoints for our: 

- [Integration][external.ssfOut-stream-endpoint-int] Environment.
- [Production][external.ssfOut-stream-endpoint-prod] Environment.

Once you have managed to view your configuration, you can then begin testing in the GOV.UK One Login [integration evironment][ssfOut.integration-testing].
