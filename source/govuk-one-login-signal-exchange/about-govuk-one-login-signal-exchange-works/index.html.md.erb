# How the GOV.UK One Login Signal Exchange works 

When a user is redirected from your service to GOV.UK One Login, One Login records the user's activity during their interaction. As the user interacts with One Login, certain activities will trigger different signals which the GOV.UK One Login Signal Transmitter may send programatically to your receiver using a `POST` request.

The signals will be sent asynchronously and independently of the One Login flow.

## What kind of signals can One Login send to you

The GOV.UK One Login Signal Exchange uses the [Shared Signals Events Framework][external.ssf-framework] (SSE) to send user related activity. Signals that are supported are:

* Specific to users interacting with GOV.UK One Login with your service.
* Signals related to the user but not to an interaction with your service.

<%= warning_text('You cannot receive signals about users interacting with GOV.UK One Login with different government services') %>

Find out what to consider before you [integrate your service with the GOV.UK One Login Signal Exchange][ssfOut.before-you-integrate].
