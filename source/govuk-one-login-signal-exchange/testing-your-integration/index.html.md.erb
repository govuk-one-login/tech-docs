# Testing your integration in GOV.UK One Login integration environment 

Once you have built the necessary [services][ssfOut.before-you-integrate], you can start testing your integration with GOV.UK One Login and the GOV.UK One Login Signal Exchange 

To get started, first get in touch with your Engagement Manager, they will work with you and the GOV.UK One Login Signal Exchange team to perform a [health check][ssfOut.health]. By performing a health check, we are establishing connectivity between the GOV.UK One Login Signal Exchange integration environment and your receiver.

Once the health check is complete, the rest of the integration requirements will need to be [addressed][ssfOut.before-you-integrate] and some additional changes will be made by the GOV.UK One Login Signal Exchange to enable the delivery of the signals that have been agreed upon.

Once the changes are complete, you can continue with your [integration][integrate.integrate] with GOV.UK One Login and begin [testing][integrate.test-connection] your integration with GOV.UK One Login as normal. 

As you interact with One Login's integration environment, signals will be generated and delivered to your receiver.

After testing is complete, you can move towards [Configuring your service for Production][ssfOut.production]
