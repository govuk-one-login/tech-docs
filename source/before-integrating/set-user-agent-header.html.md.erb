# Setting a User-Agent header on HTTP requests

When your service calls GOV.UK One Login directly it is important to ensure your HTTP client sets a
[`User-Agent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/User-Agent) header in all HTTP
requests.

Failure to set the required header will result in your service receiving a `403 Forbidden` error message from the
GOV.UK One Login service.

Most libraries and platforms do this automatically, but some do not. Your User-Agent header should contain your platform
or library and the version, for example `curl/7.64.1` or `PostmanRuntime/7.26.5`.

You can further augment this by identifying your service, by including the service URL,
as this could be useful when debugging any issues you be encountering, for example:

```
User-Agent: my-platform/version (https://my-service-url.gov.uk)
```

The value you choose should be consistently used on every direct call to the GOV.UK One Login.
