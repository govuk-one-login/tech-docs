# Before you integrate with GOV.UK One Login

When you plan your integration with GOV.UK One Login, you should consider:

* how many services within your organisation you’re planning to integrate
* if your services need to share users, in case you’re integrating more than 1 service
* if you need to create a reusable component to standardise integration across your organisation, in case you’re integrating a large number of services
* what the scope of your individual services is and whether this meets the GOV.UK Service Standard definition of a service

Make sure you scope your services according to the [GOV.UK Service Standard guidance](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) on how users think and what they need to do. Find more [information on scoping your service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/scoping-your-service).
