# Set up your public and private keys

GOV.UK One Login uses public key cryptography to authenticate services, so you’ll need to create a key pair (a public key and a corresponding private key). Then you’ll need to [share your public key with GOV.UK One Login][integrate.share-public-key] when registering your service.

You’ll also need to use your private key when:

* you’re registering your service to use GOV.UK One Login environments, such as integration or production
* you request the token using the private key authentication mechanism on the `/token` endpoint

## Create a key pair 

You can create a key pair using [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/). After you’ve installed OpenSSL, run the following on your command line to create your key pair:

```
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
```

You have now created your key pair, which will appear on your machine as 2 files:

* `public_key.pem` - this is your public key, which you should share with GOV.UK One Login
* `private_key.pem` - this is your private key, which you should store securely and not share

<%= warning_text('Once you’ve generated your private key, you must store the key in a secure location, such as a file vault. You must not share your private key.') %>

## Share your public key with GOV.UK One Login

Once you’ve created your key pair, share your public key with GOV.UK One Login. You have 2 options to do this:

* [share a fixed public key][integrate.share-a-fixed-public-key] directly. If you use a fixed public key and start signing with a new key before GOV.UK One Login updates your service’s configuration, users will not be able to access your service with GOV.UK One Login.

* (recommended) [share your public key(s) using a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint][integrate.share-public-keys-JWKS-endpoint]


To prevent this, we recommend using a JWKS endpoint to share your public keys instead. A JWKS endpoint is a read-only URL that returns JWKSs as JSON objects so you can share multiple public keys. If you do this, you can rotate your keys without contacting us for a configuration change. You can update the JWKS endpoint to contain both the old and new keys, then immediately start signing with the new key. 
This means users can still access your service with GOV.UK One Login.

### Share a fixed public key 
If you’re using a fixed public key, send the public key you created to GOV.UK One Login. You can check what to send when you [contact the GOV.UK One Login team to register your service][integrate.register-your-service].

Once you've created your key pair and shared a fixed public key, you can [choose which user attributes your service can request][integrate.choose-user-attributes].

### Share your public keys using a JWKS endpoint

If you're using a JWKS endpoint, you'll need to make sure it works with GOV.UK One Login. 

This means your endpoint must:
* use HTTPS
* be publicly accessible 
* return a `HTTP 200 (OK)` within 5 seconds of a `GET`
* return an RSA signing key in JWKS format
* return a unique `kid` parameter in each key (`JWK`) entry
* include the `kid` parameter for the key used to sign a `JWS` in its header

Your JWKS endpoint should give a JSON response similar to the following example: 

```
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kty": "RSA",
      "e": "AQAB",
      "use": "sig",
      "kid": "f58a6bef-0d22-444b-b4d3-507a54e9892f",
      "n": "pSx43eUV2hZ3AJKYNFHxOsILQ_tUNpfPVELCy3js3FsTp5Mcbpb8mu-arekTCq0Mx5-uqRhJKuT1eGf5DIsb69P__Eyi787Q2o5CdbDwB4iUlEffgx_KuOWUm_4YEuVSjnxfS_hB9h_38zQ6WtD1NnCbcMk4RT2MRvCSiIr9OhjKn9AExH7aaDY7nPm0uVybMkNf5hzBBJWsblBGLmFqnw-qHIEGJaC0M2yZEfXJDbdeZx-IYEYMi3QrR_y4yWzQP2RC8QDU84-uj5mAy5vn06RSdAHNXdiuUX3dIFlerri8gSXo5dPps-gU7igauHnX6mP0HBDtnoNKcM1gpXrnKw"
    }
  ]
}
```

Once you have shared a JWKS endpoint URL, you can [choose which user attributes your service can request][integrate.choose-user-attributes].

#### Revoking a public key on your JWKS endpoint

You must contact GOV.UK One Login if you need to immediately revoke a public key on your JWKS endpoint. 

We cache keys for up to 24 hours, so do not remove a compromised key from your JWKS endpoint without telling GOV.UK One Login.
