# Choose which user attributes your service can request

Your service can request certain user attributes. To do this, you need to choose which ‘scopes’ and ‘claims’ your service will use and include these when you make your request to the `/authorize` endpoint.

OpenID Connect (OIDC) scopes are identifiers your application uses during authentication to authorise access to a user’s attributes, such as an email address. Each scope returns a set of user attributes contained within it. OIDC calls this set of user attributes ‘claims’.

The user attributes and how you request them will depend on whether you are requesting authentication only, or authentication with a level of identity confidence.

| Type of request you’re making        | What type of user attributes you can request                                         |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Authentication only                  | You can only [request user attributes using scopes][integrate.choose-request-scope]. |
| Authentication and identity proving  | You can request user attributes using a combination of scopes and claims, depending on what your service needs. |

You'll need to agree which scopes and claims you want to use when you [register your service to use GOV.UK One Login][integrate.register-your-service].

## Choose which scopes your service can request

`openid` is the only scope you must include. You can choose to include other scopes for your request to the `/authorize` endpoint depending on the user attributes your service needs.

You can find details of the scopes in the following table.

| Scope             | Required or optional  | Description         |
|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| `openid`          | Required              | OIDC requests to the `/authorize` endpoint must contain the `openid` scope value to indicate that an application intends to use the OIDC protocol. <br> <br>This will return the sub claim, which uniquely identifies your user. |
| `email`           | Optional              | Returns the `email` claim, which contains:<ul><li>your user's email address</li><li>`email_verified`, which is a boolean indicating whether your user has verified their email address or not</li></ul> |
| `phone`           | Optional              | Returns the `phone_number` claim, which contains:<ul><li>your user's phone number</li><li>`phone_number_verified`, which is a boolean indicating whether your user has verified their phone number or not</li></ul> |

## Choose which claims your service can request

You can also request specific claims from GOV.UK One Login, if you need more information than the scopes in the previous section can provide. You must [choose a level of identity confidence][integrate.choose-level-of-confidence] `P2` or above, otherwise you will not receive any claims in the authorisation response.

You can find details of the claims in the following table.

| Claim                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

You can see more about the structure of this information when you [prove your user’s identity](integrate-with-integration-environment/prove-users-identity).

You can only ask us for claims that are covered by your [Data Protection Impact Assessment](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/data-protection-impact-assessments-dpias/). You must clearly explain to your users why you are collecting the data and what you will use it for.

Once you have chosen which attributes your service can request, you can [create a configuration for each service you’re integrating][integrate.create-configurations-for-each-service].
