# Prove your user's identity

You must have authenticated your users before you can prove their identity.

If you [requested identity proving][integrate.choose-level-of-confidence], when
you [retrieve user information with `/userinfo`][integrate.retrieve-user-info], you’ll receive a response containing
additional claims (user attributes). You may receive different claims, depending on how your user proved their identity.

Your service’s needs will determine how you process the other claims that GOV.UK One Login provides about your user.
You’ll probably need to match against information held by your service or organisations you work with.

Most claims are represented by JSON objects. The [core identity claim](#understand-your-user-s-core-identity-claim) is a
JSON web token (JWT) protected by an electronic signature for additional security.

You’ll receive a response from `/userinfo` that will look similar to this example:

## Understand your user’s core identity claim
The `https://vocab.account.gov.uk/v1/coreIdentityJWT` property in the `/userinfo` response is the core identity claim,
which is a JWT representing core identity attributes.

The following are core identity attributes:

* your user's name
* your user’s date of birth
* the level of identity confidence GOV.UK One Login has reached

<%= warning_text("If the <code>https://vocab.account.gov.uk/v1/coreIdentityJWT</code> property is not present, then GOV.UK One Login was not able to prove your user's identity.") %>

Our support team will give you the public key you must use to validate this JWT. We recommend
you [use a certified JWT/JWS implementation](https://openid.net/developers/jwt/).

The JWT contains the following claims:

          "value": "1970-01-01"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The `vc` claim in the JWT is a [verifiable credential (VC)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/). Claims about your
user are contained in the `credentialSubject` JSON object.

### Validate your user’s identity credential

1. You must validate the JWT signature according to
   the [JSON Web Signature Specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515). Check the JWT `alg` header
   is `ES256` and then use the value of the JWT `alg` header parameter to validate the JWT.
1. Check the `iss` claim is `https://identity.integration.account.gov.uk/`.
1. Check the `aud` claim matches your client ID you received when you [registered your service to use GOV.UK One Login][integrate.register-your-service].
1. Check the `sub` claim matches the `sub` claim you received
   in [the `id_token` from your token request](../authenticate-your-user/#understand-your-id-token).
1. Check the current time is before the time in the `exp` claim.

### Check your user’s level of authentication protection matches the requested level

You must look for the `vot` claim in the ID Token and make sure the level of protection matches or exceeds the level a user needs to access your service. If you make an identity request, this vot will only contain the credential trust level, not the level of confidence.
You may receive a lower level of confidence than you requested. For example, if you asked for medium
confidence (`P2`), you may receive an identity credential containing low confidence (`P1` in the `vot` claim). Additionally, if you ask for medium confidence ('P2') you must also request a protection level of Cl.Cm. This means logging in with second factor authenticaion. If you do not do this, you will receive an error back `invalid_request - Request vtr not valid`.

  ### Process your user’s identity credential

The identity credential contains the following claims as properties of `credentialSubject`.

| Property    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `name`      | A list showing the names proven by GOV.UK One Login. This list reflects name changes by using the `validFrom` and `validUntil` metadata properties. If `validUntil` is `null` or not present, that name is your user’s current name. If `validFrom` is `null` or not present, your user may have used that name from birth. <br><br> Each name is presented as an array in the `nameParts` property. Each part of the name is either a `GivenName` or a `FamilyName`, identified in its `type` property. The `value` property could be any text string. GOV.UK One Login cannot specify a maximum length or restrictions on what characters may appear. <br><br> `GivenName` or `FamilyName` can appear in any order within the list. The order of names may depend on either your user’s preferences or the order they appear on documents used to prove your user’s identity. |
| `birthDate` | A list of [ISO 8601 date][external.ISO-8601-date] strings. There may be multiple dates of birth, for example, if there’s evidence an incorrect date of birth was previously recorded for your user. The date of birth GOV.UK One Login has highest confidence in will be the first item in the list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Do not assume address properties always map to the same line of an address. For example, <code>addressLocality</code>
may map to a different line of an address, depending on whether other properties are present (in this case, <code>
dependentAddressLocality</code> and <code>doubleDependentAddressLocality</code>).

## Understand your user’s return code claim

The `https://vocab.account.gov.uk/v1/returnCode` claim gives information about any issues with the evidence your user provided to prove their identity. For example, if GOV.UK One Login was not able to prove your user’s identity. 

To use this claim, you must let us know when [registering your service with GOV.UK One Login][integrate.register-your-service].

When you use this claim and there’s an issue with the evidence your user provided to prove their identity:

1. You’ll receive an authorisation code in the `redirect_uri` instead of an `access_denied` error.
1. Use this authorisation code to get an ID token and an access token.
1. When you make a request to the `/userinfo` endpoint using the access token, the response may contain only authentication data, and an array of one or more `returnCode` values, for example `[{"code": "B"},{"code": "C"}]`.
1. For security reasons, you’ll need to contact GOV.UK One Login on [govuk-one-login@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-one-login@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) for more detailed information on what each return code means.  

You may receive a return code even if a user’s identity verification is successful. Contact GOV.UK One Login on [govuk-one-login@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-one-login@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) for more detailed information on what each return code means.  

| Property         | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `code`     | An array of single letter codes for `returnCode` values. <br><br> You can use these codes to identify the reason(s) for any issues that occurred during the identity proving journey. For security reasons, you’ll need to contact GOV.UK One Login on [govuk-one-login@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-one-login@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) for more detailed information on what each return code means.
