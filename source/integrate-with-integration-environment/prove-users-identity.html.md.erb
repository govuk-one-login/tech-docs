# Prove your user's identity

You must have authenticated your users before you can prove their identity.

If you [requested identity proving][integrate.choose-level-of-confidence], when
you [retrieve user information with `/userinfo`][integrate.retrieve-user-info], you’ll receive a response containing
additional claims (user attributes). You may receive different claims, depending on how your user proved their identity.

Your service’s needs will determine how you process the other claims that GOV.UK One Login provides about your user.
You’ll probably need to match against information held by your service or organisations you work with.

Most claims are represented by JSON objects. The [core identity claim](#understand-your-user-s-core-identity-claim) is a
JSON web token (JWT) protected by an electronic signature for additional security.

You’ll receive a response from `/userinfo` that will look similar to this example:

## Understand your user’s core identity claim
The `https://vocab.account.gov.uk/v1/coreIdentityJWT` property in the `/userinfo` response is the core identity claim,
which is a JWT representing core identity attributes.

The following are core identity attributes:

* your user's name
* your user’s date of birth
* the level of identity confidence GOV.UK One Login has reached

<%= warning_text("If the <code>https://vocab.account.gov.uk/v1/coreIdentityJWT</code> property is not present, then GOV.UK One Login was not able to prove your user's identity.") %>

Our support team will give you the public key you must use to validate this JWT. We recommend you [use a certified JWT/JWS implementation](https://openid.net/developers/jwt/). We also supply a DID Document which contains the current JWT, see [Validating the JWT](#validating-the-jwt).

The JWT contains the following claims:

              "type": "FamilyName"

      "birthDate": [

          "value": "1970-01-01"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The `vc` claim in the JWT is a [verifiable credential (VC)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/). Claims about your
user are contained in the `credentialSubject` JSON object.

## Validating the JWT
The public keys you must use to validate this JWT are published by GOV.UK One Login as [Decentralized Identifier (DID) documents](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and can be downloaded from one of the following endpoints:

| Environment | Endpoint                                                         |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Integration | https://identity.integration.account.gov.uk/.well-known/did.json |
| Production  | https://identity.account.gov.uk/.well-known/did.json             |

You should read this endpoint when validating a document. However, to reduce latency we recommend caching the returned DID Document. To facilitate the endpoint includes the `Cache-Control` HTTP header field which holds directives how the result of the endpoint should be cached and how long the DID Document is expected to remain valid. For example, the following response header says that the result is expected to remain valid for up to 1 hour (3600 seconds / 60 seconds = 60 minutes or 1 hour), and that it should be cached only by the requester and not in a shared cache. For more details on the Cache-Control header see [RFC 9111: HTTP Caching](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#field.cache-control).

```
Cache-Control: max-age=3600, private
...
```

The DID Document returned by the service is published using the `did:web` method, see [did:web Method Specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/) for further information, section [2.5.2 Read (Resolve)](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web) describes how to resolve the DID Document from the `kid`. The following is an example of a web DID Document which may be downloaded from the GOV.UK One Login service.

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/security/jwk/v1"
  ],
  "id": "did:web:identity.account.gov.uk",
  "assertionMethod": [
    {
      "id": "cfeebabeeac2d9749993523f143fbc3f8c83411853f2996323a2efbd7acda754",
      "type": "JsonWebKey",
      "controller": "did:web:staging.identity.account.gov.uk",
      "publicKeyJwk": {
        "kty": "EC",
        "crv": "P-256",
        "x": "1_WJai9R0PRJrw12kRRq_dk1Kh5eSll7QYC2JTrY0Hg",
        "y": "Wm5YhRJSsXVmAFGCEUgNBJyvR-oAQo2xvYA9DMVMYdk"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

When validating a JWT the JWT header will include a `kid` (Key ID) in the format `{scheme}:{DID-method}:{DID-method-specific identifier}#{unique key identifier}`. The `kid` can be used to determine which public key was used to the sign the JWT:
* `{scheme}:{DID-method}:{DID-method-specific identifier}` should always match the `id` within the DID Document. For example `did:web:identity.account.gov.uk`.
* `{unique key identifier}` should always match one `id` within the DID Document `assertionMethod` array. For example, `cfeebabeeac2d9749993523f143fbc3f8c83411853f2996323a2efbd7acda754`.

One Login will rotate it's keys on regular basis and, in the event of a compromised key, will need to rotate at short notice. When we rotate keys the new public key will be added to the `assertionMethod` array in advance to allow time for all relying parties to consume prior to rotation. The old public key will be removed following a rotation, after which time the key will no longer be valid and should not be trusted. 

### Validate your user’s identity credential

1. You must validate the JWT signature according to
   the [JSON Web Signature Specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515). Check the JWT `alg` header
   is `ES256` and then use the value of the JWT `alg` header parameter to validate the JWT.
1. Check the `iss` claim is `https://identity.integration.account.gov.uk/`.
1. Check the `aud` claim matches your client ID you received when you [registered your service to use GOV.UK One Login][integrate.register-your-service].
1. Check the `sub` claim matches the `sub` claim you received
   in [the `id_token` from your token request](../authenticate-your-user/#understand-your-id-token).
1. Check the current time is before the time in the `exp` claim.

### Check your user’s level of authentication protection matches the requested level

You must look for the `vot` (Vector of Trust) claim in the ID token and make sure the level of protection matches or exceeds the level a user needs to access your service. The `vot` claim will only contain the credential trust level, not the level of confidence, even if you make an identity request.
Additionally, if you ask for medium confidence (`P2`) you must also request a protection level of `Cl.Cm`. This means logging in with two-factor authenticaion. If you do not do this, you'll receive the error: `invalid_request - Request vtr not valid`.


### Process your user’s identity credential

The identity credential contains the following claims as properties of `credentialSubject`.

| Property    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `name`      | A list showing the names proven by GOV.UK One Login. This list reflects name changes by using the `validFrom` and `validUntil` metadata properties. If `validUntil` is `null` or not present, that name is your user’s current name. If `validFrom` is `null` or not present, your user may have used that name from birth. <br><br> Each name is presented as an array in the `nameParts` property. Each part of the name is either a `GivenName` or a `FamilyName`, identified in its `type` property. The `value` property could be any text string. GOV.UK One Login cannot specify a maximum length or restrictions on what characters may appear. <br><br> `GivenName` or `FamilyName` can appear in any order within the list. The order of names may depend on either your user’s preferences or the order they appear on documents used to prove your user’s identity. |
| `birthDate` | A list of [ISO 8601 date][external.ISO-8601-date] strings. There may be multiple dates of birth, for example, if there’s evidence an incorrect date of birth was previously recorded for your user. The date of birth GOV.UK One Login has highest confidence in will be the first item in the list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Understand your user’s address claim
The `https://vocab.account.gov.uk/v1/address` claim contains all addresses your user has declared, including previous
addresses.

Each JSON object in the list may contain any of the following properties:

Do not assume address properties always map to the same line of an address. For example, <code>addressLocality</code>
may map to a different line of an address, depending on whether other properties are present (in this case, <code>
dependentAddressLocality</code> and <code>doubleDependentAddressLocality</code>).

## Understand your user’s return code claim

The `https://vocab.account.gov.uk/v1/returnCode` claim gives information about any issues with the evidence your user provided to prove their identity. For example, if GOV.UK One Login was not able to prove your user’s identity. 

To use this claim, you must let us know when [registering your service with GOV.UK One Login][integrate.register-your-service].

When you use this claim and there’s an issue with the evidence your user provided to prove their identity:

1. You’ll receive an authorisation code in the `redirect_uri` instead of an `access_denied` error.
1. Use this authorisation code to get an ID token and an access token.
1. When you make a request to the `/userinfo` endpoint using the access token, the response may contain only authentication data, and an array of one or more `returnCode` values, which will each be a letter.
1. For security reasons, you’ll need to contact GOV.UK One Login on [govuk-one-login@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-one-login@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) for more detailed information on what issue each `returnCode` value stands for.  

Currently, there are 11 `returnCode` values which GOV.UK One Login could return if there’s an issue with the evidence your user provided to prove their identity. You may receive a return code even if a user’s identity verification is successful, for example, if a user is a politically exposed person. Contact GOV.UK One Login on [govuk-one-login@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-one-login@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) for more detailed information on what each return code means.  

| Property         | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `code`     | An array of single letter codes for `returnCode` values. <br><br> You can use these codes to identify the reason(s) for any issues that occurred during the identity proving journey. For security reasons, you’ll need to contact GOV.UK One Login on [govuk-one-login@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-one-login@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) for more detailed information on what each return code means.
