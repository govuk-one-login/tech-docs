# Re-authenticate users

A relying party (RP) may want to re-authenticate a user who has an active session with them.

The current implementation of re-authentication can only be used by an RP to ensure that the user who started the journey is still the same person. 

It cannot be used to ensure that a user who may or may not have an active One Login session is forced to re-enter their username and password.

Re-authentication is supported only for JWT-secured OAuth 2.0 authorisation requests (JARs).

## Implementation

To re-authenticate a user the RP must have:

* an existing user session
* an ID token from GOV.UK One Login

An RP must then use the following table to input values into the required parameters (along with the standard parameters) as part of an authorisation request:

| Parameter name  | Required or optional | Expected value  |
|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| `prompt`        | Required             | `login`         |
| `id_token_hint` | Required<br/>(for re-authentication scenario)    | ID token received by RP from GOV.UK One Login<br><br>Note: If ID token is populated along with prompt=login, then the system will re-authenticate         |

As part of the re-authentication process GOV.UK One Login will take the users through the re-authentication journey. The level of protection will be the same as the original authentication which is read from the ID Token passed in as part of the request. After a successful authentication and token exchanges, a refreshed ID token will be issued by GOV.UK One Login.

After a successful re-authentication, GOV.UK One Login will redirect a user back to the RP with an authorisation code (similar to the normal sign-in journey). The RP must then:
request the ID token
validate the ID token for the latest timestamp and match the subject ID to  make sure it is the same subject ID

## Troubleshooting 

If an ID token has expired then GOV.UK One Login will return an error code.
