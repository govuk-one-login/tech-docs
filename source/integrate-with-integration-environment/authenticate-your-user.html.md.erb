# Authenticate your user

To get an access token which will allow you to access basic user information, you’ll need to integrate with [OAuth’s Authorization Code Flow](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html).

## Use the discovery endpoint

You can use the [discovery endpoint][external.oidc-discovery] to get information needed to interact with GOV.UK One Login, for example:

* issuer name
* information about the keys
* supported scopes, which will contain the user attributes your service can request

## Make a request to the `/authorize` endpoint

You can send a request to the `/authorize` endpoint to:

* authenticate your user
* check your user’s level of identity confidence - you must have authenticated your user first

Choose one of the following example messages to make your own `GET` request. You can use the following table to [replace the placeholders in your example message][integrate.replace-example-message].

### Make a request for authentication

To authenticate your user, customise the following example `GET` request by [replacing the example’s placeholder values][integrate.replace-example-message]. 

The following example specifies a medium level of authentication. There’s further guidance on choosing the [level of authentication][integrate.choose-level-of-auth].

```
GET /authorize?response_type=code
&scope=YOUR_SCOPES
&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
&state=STATE
&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI
&nonce=aEwkamaos5B
&vtr=["Cl.Cm"]
&ui_locales=en

HTTP/1.1
Host: oidc.integration.account.gov.uk
```

<%= warning_text('This code example uses formatting that makes it easier to read. If you copy the example, you must make sure the request is:<ul><li>a continuous line of text separating each parameter with an ampersand (&)</li><li>not split across multiple lines</li><li>without any additional separators such as newline, commas or tabs</li></ul>') %>

### Make a request for authentication and identity

If you need to authenticate your user and check their identity, you should send 2 separate requests: one for authentication and one for identity. 

1. [Send a request to the `/authorize` endpoint to authenticate your user][integrate.make-authorization-request] specifying the Vector of Trust (vtr) parameter as ["Cl.Cm"].
1. Send a request for identity to the `/authorize` endpoint specifying the Vector of Trust parameter `vtr` as ["Cl.Cm.P2"].

By using 2 separate requests: 

* more users are likely to create their account successfully
* you can track which users could not prove their identity
* you can support your users better when returning from an in-person identity check because you’ll have authenticated them previously
* you simplify the migration of existing users to GOV.UK One Login

The following example uses medium authentication (`Cl.Cm`) and a medium level of identity confidence (`P2`). There’s further guidance on choosing the [level of authentication][integrate.choose-level-of-auth] and choosing the [level of identity confidence][integrate.choose-level-of-confidence].

You can [replace your example's placeholder values][integrate.replace-example-message].

```
GET /authorize?response_type=code
&scope=YOUR_SCOPES
&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
&state=STATE
&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI
&nonce=aEwkamaos5B
&vtr=["Cl.Cm.P2"]
&ui_locales=en
&claims=<claims-request>
HTTP/1.1
Host: oidc.integration.account.gov.uk
```

<%= warning_text('This code example uses formatting that makes it easier to read. If you copy the example, you must make sure the request is:<ul><li>a continuous line of text separating each parameter with an ampersand (&)</li><li>not split across multiple lines</li><li>without any additional separators such as newline, commas or tabs</li></ul>') %>

#### Create a URL-encoded JSON object for `<claims-request>`

After you’ve made a request for authentication and identity, you should then create a URL-encoded JSON object for ``<claims-request>``. Your JSON object should look similar to this example:

```
{
  "userinfo": {
    "https://vocab.account.gov.uk/v1/coreIdentityJWT": null,
    "https://vocab.account.gov.uk/v1/address": null,
    "https://vocab.account.gov.uk/v1/passport": null,
    "https://vocab.account.gov.uk/v1/drivingPermit": null
  }
}
```

You can only request user attributes to be returned in the `/userinfo` response. You cannot configure the claims returned in the [ID token][integrate.understand-id-token].

### Secure your authorisation request parameters with JWT 

You can use a JWT-secured OAuth 2.0 authorisation request (JAR) with encoded parameters to protect your request from attacks and hackers. 

GOV.UK One Login follows the [OIDC principles on passing request objects](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#RequestObject).

1. Build a request object and sign it using the [private key you created][integrate.generate-key-pair] when setting up your integration with GOV.UK One Login.
1. Encode the signed request object.
1. Make a `GET` request replacing `YOU_REQUEST_OBJECT` with your signed and encoded request object.

Use this example to make your own `GET` request, replacing the placeholder values: 

```
GET /authorize?response_type=code
&scope=YOUR_SCOPES
&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
&request=YOUR_REQUEST_OBJECT
HTTP/1.1
Host: oidc.integration.account.gov.uk
```

You must make sure:

* `response_type`, `scope`, and `client_id` are identical in the query parameters and the request object
* you do not set any other OIDC parameters using query parameters

Before you encode and sign the request object, it should look similar to this example:

```
{
  "aud":   "https://oidc.integration.account.gov.uk/authorize",
  "iss": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "response_type": "code",
  "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "redirect_uri": "https://client.example.org/cb",
  "scope": "YOUR_SCOPES",
  "state": "af0ifjsldkj",
  "nonce": "n-0S6_WzA2Mj",
  "vtr": [
    "Cl.Cm.P2"
  ],
  "ui_locales": "en",
  "claims": {
    "userinfo": {
      "https://vocab.account.gov.uk/v1/coreIdentityJWT": null,
      "https://vocab.account.gov.uk/v1/address": null,
      "https://vocab.account.gov.uk/v1/passport": null,
      "https://vocab.account.gov.uk/v1/drivingPermit": null
    }
  }
}
```

You can [replace your example’s placeholder values][integrate.replace-example-message].


### Replace the placeholder values in your example

Use the guidance in the following table to replace placeholder values in your example message.


| Parameter       | Required or optional | Description    |
|-----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| `response_type` | Required             | You must set this value to be code: `response_type=code`.<br><br>If you’re using JAR, make sure the `response_type` values in the query parameters and the request object are identical. |
| `scope`         | Required             | A space-separated list of scopes. You must include `openid` as one scope value.<br>You should refer to the guidance on [choosing which user attributes your service can request][integrate.choose-user-attributes] for the `scope` parameter.<br><br>If you’re using JAR, make sure the `scope` values in the query parameters and the request object are identical. |
| `client_id`     | Required             | The [client identifier][integrate.client-id], which we generated for you, when you [registered your service to use GOV.UK One Login][integrate.register-your-service].<br><br>If you’re using JAR, make sure the `client_id` values in the query parameters and the request object are identical. |
| `state`         | Required             | When you receive a response at the redirect URL, there must be a way to verify the response came for a request which you sent. The `state` value solves this issue by binding the request and response, which reduces impact of [Cross Site Request Forgery](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf) attacks.<br>This value will be returned to the client in the authentication response. |
| `redirect_uri`  | Required             | You’ll have specified your `redirect_uri` when you [registered your service to use GOV.UK One Login][integrate.register-your-service].<br><br>The redirect URI must exactly match one of the redirect URIs you registered with GOV.UK One Login.<br><br>If you’re using request parameters, the value must be URL-encoded. |
| `nonce`         | Required             | A unique value generated by your application that is used to verify the integrity of the `id_token` and mitigate replay attacks.<br>This value will be present in the `id_token` and should include the per-session state, as well as being impossible for attackers to guess.<br>Your application will need to verify the `nonce` claim value is the same as the `nonce` parameter sent in the authentication request. |
| `aud`           | Optional             | If you’re using JAR, you must include `aud` in your JSON object.<br><br>You must set this value to specify GOV.UK One Login’s authorisation server as the intended audience: `aud=https://oidc.integration.account.gov.uk/authorize`. |
| `iss`           | Optional             | If you’re using JAR, the `iss` parameter is required.<br><br>You must set this value to be your `client_id`. GOV.UK One Login generated your `client_id` when you [registered your service to use GOV.UK One Login][integrate.register-your-service]. |
| `ui_locales`    | Optional             | GOV.UK One Login supports English and Welsh as language choices. <br><br> If your service is in Welsh, you may want to display GOV.UK One Login in Welsh for a consistent user experience. You can use `ui_locales` to do this. <br> <br> In the `ui_locales` parameter, you can choose either `en` (English) or `cy` (Welsh). <br><br> Using `ui_locales` is optional. If you do not include it, your service will continue using English by default. <br><br> GOV.UK One Login does not support any other languages. |
| `vtr`           | Optional             | The `vtr` parameter represents ‘Vectors of Trust’ where you request authentication and, optionally, identity proving. For example, if you want the medium level of authentication and medium identity confidence, request `vtr=[“Cl.Cm.P2”]`. <br><br>You selected your Vector of Trust when you [chose the level of authentication][integrate.choose-level-of-auth] and [the level of identity confidence][integrate.choose-level-of-confidence] for your service.<br><br>You can read more about how to combine the vectors for authentication level and identity confidence in [Section 3 of RFC 8485](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8485#section-3.1). If you need identity proving, you must request `Cl.Cm` (the medium level of authentication) or higher (higher levels of authentication will be available soon).<br><br>If you do not specify the `vtr` parameter, your service will automatically log your users in at the medium level of authentication (`Cl.Cm`). This means you will not receive identity attributes in your response. |
| `claims`        | Optional             | To get the identity attributes your service needs, you should specify these in the `claims` parameter using the `/userinfo` endpoint. The `/userinfo` endpoint returns a JSON object listing the requested claims.<br><br>You can read more about [choosing which user attributes your service can request][integrate.choose-user-attributes].<br><br>You can [read more about the structure of the claims request in OpenID Connect section 5.5](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClaimsParameter). |

### Generate an authorisation code

If your user does not have an existing session they’re signed in to when your service makes the request to the `/authorize` endpoint, the OIDC sign-in page will open. Your user can enter their details on this page to authenticate themselves.

If your user has an existing session, or after they authenticate, they will be redirected to the `redirect_uri` your service specified.

The authorisation code generated by your user’s session can be used once and displays in the query string of the URL, for example:

```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://YOUR_REDIRECT_URI?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&state=xyzABC123
```

If your request included the `state` parameter, the URI will also include this parameter.

### Error handling for ‘Make a request to the `/authorize` endpoint’

To understand more about what the error is, you can look in the response. Depending on the type of error you receive, the response may contain an `error` and an `error_description` which will provide you with information.

If there’s an error in your request, you’ll be redirected to the URI you specified for `redirect_uri` in the authorisation URL. You’ll be able to see the error description tagged onto the end of the authorisation URL, for example:

```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://YOUR_REDIRECT_URI?error=invalid_request
&error_description=Unsupported%20response
&state=1234
```

## Make a token request

You need to exchange your [authorisation code][integrate.generate-auth-code] for tokens. You'll use these tokens to make a call to the `/userinfo` endpoint.

To exchange your authorisation code for tokens, you'll need to make a `POST` request to the `/token` endpoint using the client authentication method `private_key_jwt`.

Before you can make a `POST` request, you need to:

1. Create a JWT assertion.
1. Include the JWT assertion in your `POST` request.

GOV.UK One Login will then authenticate your request by verifying the signature and payload of the JWT assertion. This authentication will generate a token response, which will include:

* an access token
* an ID token
* a refresh token - you'll use this if you want to access the `/userinfo` endpoint for longer than 3 minutes

### Create a JWT assertion

To create a JWT assertion, you need to:

1. Use the [key pair you generated][integrate.generate-key-pair] earlier in the process.
1. Create a JWT.
1. Sign your JWT with the key you created - how you sign your JWT will vary depending on the language you’re using.

#### Create a JWT

To create a JWT assertion, you need to create a JWT which contains certain required claims. There’s some optional claims you can choose to include or not include.


| Claim   | Required or recommended | Description    |
|---------|-------------------------|----------------|
| `aud`   | Required                | `aud` stands for 'audience'. This identifies GOV.UK One Login’s authorisation server as an intended audience. This value should be the URL: https://oidc.integration.account.gov.uk/token. |
| `iss`   | Required                | `iss` stands for 'issuer'. This claim should contain your `client_id` you got when you [registered your service to use GOV.UK One Login][integrate.register-your-service]. |
| `sub`   | Required                | `sub` stands for 'subject'. This claim should contain your `client_id` you got when you [registered your service to use GOV.UK One Login][integrate.register-your-service]. |
| `exp`   | Required                | `exp` stands for 'expiration time'. This is the expiration time for this token, which must be an integer timestamp representing the number of seconds since the [Unix Epoch][external.unix-epoch].  This is the time after which you must not accept the JWT. We recommend an expiration after 5 minutes. <br>The current date and time must be before the expiration date and time listed in the `exp` claim. |
| `jti`   | Required                | `jti` stands for ‘JWT ID’. In this claim, you should include a unique identifier for the token. <br>This unique identifier will prevent the token being reused as your application must only use these tokens once. |
| `iat`   | Recommended             | `iat` stands for ‘issued at’. This identifies the time at which your application created the JWT. You can use this claim to understand the age of the JWT.<br>This must appear as an integer timestamp representing the number of seconds since the [Unix Epoch][external.unix-epoch]. |

Your JWT body will look similar to this example:

```
{
  "aud":"https://oidc.integration.account.gov.uk/token",
  "iss":"38174623762",
  "sub":"38174623762",
  "exp":1536165540,
  "jti":"RANDOM_VALUE_JTI",
  "iat":1536132708
}
```

Once you have created your JWT and signed your JWT with the key pair, you have created your JWT assertion.

### Make a `POST` request to the `/token` endpoint

Now you have generated your JWT assertion, you’re ready to make a `POST` request to the `/token` endpoint, for example:

```
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: oidc.integration.account.gov.uk
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code
&code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA

| `client_assertion_type` | Required                | When you’re using `private_key_jwt`, you must set the value to `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer`.                                   |
| `code`                  | Required                | The code you received when you [generated an authorisation code][integrate.generate-auth-code].                                                                                        |

### Receive response for ‘Make a token request’

If your token request is successful, the `/token` endpoint will return a response similar to this example:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "access_token": "SlAV32hkKG",
  "refresh_token": "i6mapTIAVSp2oJkgUnCACKKfZxt_H5MBLiqcybBBd04",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 180,
  "id_token":"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjFlOWdkazcifQ.ewogImlzc
    yI6ICJodHRwOi8vc2VydmVyLmV4YW1wbGUuY29tIiwKICJzdWIiOiAiMjQ4Mjg"
}
```

You can use the following table to understand the response for ‘Make a token request’.

| Parameter       | Description    |
|-----------------|----------------|
| `access_token`  | The access token value is an opaque access token which you can use with the `/userinfo` endpoint to return a user's profile. |
| `refresh_token` | You can use a refresh token if you need to request a new access token. |
| `token_type`    | The token type value. GOV.UK One Login only supports the [bearer token][external.bearer-token]. |
| `expires_in`    | The length of time the token is valid for. This is displayed in seconds. |
| `scope`         | You can read more about scopes in [choosing which user attributes your service can request][integrate.choose-user-attributes]. |
| `id_token`      | A signed JWT that contains basic attributes about the user. <br><br>By default, GOV.UK One Login signs this JWT using the `ES256` algorithm.<br><br>If your service cannot support the `ES256` algorithm (for example, some third-party tooling does not support `ES256`), GOV.UK One Login can sign the JWT using the `RS256` algorithm. You’ll have specified whether your service can support `ES256` when you [registered your service to use GOV.UK One Login][integrate.register-your-service].<br><br>The public key used to verify this JWT is available from the `jwks_uri` parameter found in the [discovery endpoint][external.oidc-discovery]. |

### Understand your ID token

The `id_token` parameter in the response for ‘Make a token request’ contains the following claims:


```
{
  "sub": "urn:fdc:gov.uk:2022:56P4CMsGh_02YOlWpd8PAOI-2sVlB2nsNU7mcLZYhYw=",
  "iss": "https://oidc.integration.account.gov.uk",
  "nonce": "aad0aa969c156b2dfa685f885fac7083",
  "aud": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "exp": 1489694196,
  "iat": 1489694198,
  "sid": "LeiKvyPXZorTmSgOTsYhPehsGNw="
}
```

You can use the following table to understand the ID token’s claims.

| Claim   | Description         |
|---------|---------------------|
| `sub`   | The subject identifier or the unique ID of a user. |
| `iss`   | The GOV.UK One Login OpenID Provider's Issue identifier as specified in the [discovery endpoint][external.oidc-discovery]. |
| `nonce` | The `nonce` value your application provided when you made the request to the `/authorize` endpoint. |
| `aud`   | The audience, which will be the `client_id` you received when you [registered your service to use GOV.UK One Login][integrate.register-your-service]. |
| `exp`   | `exp` means ‘expiration time’. This is the expiration time for this token, which will be an integer timestamp representing the number of seconds since the [Unix Epoch][external.unix-epoch]. |
| `iat`   | `iat` stands for ‘issued at’. This identifies the time at which GOV.UK One Login created the JWT. You can use this claim to understand the age of the JWT.This will appear as an integer timestamp representing the number of seconds since the [Unix Epoch][external.unix-epoch]. |
| `sid`   | `sid` stands for ‘session identifier’. This uniquely identifies the user's journey within GOV.UK One Login. |

Now you’ve understood what’s in your ID token, you’ll need to validate it.

#### Validate your ID token


1. If you’re using a library, check whether your library has support for validating ID tokens.
1. The value of `iss` must exactly match the Issuer Identifier as specified in GOV.UK One Login’s [discovery endpoint][external.oidc-discovery].
1. The `aud` claim must contain your client ID you received when you [registered your service to use GOV.UK One Login][integrate.register-your-service].
1. You must validate the signature according to the [JSON Web Signature Specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515). You must first [validate that the JWT `alg` header matches](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8725#section-3.1) what was returned from the `jwks_uri`. Then you can use the value of the JWT `alg` header parameter to validate the ID token. Your application must use the keys provided by the [discovery endpoint][external.oidc-discovery].
1. Check the current time is before the time in the `exp` claim.
1. If you set a `nonce` value in the request to the `/authorize` endpoint, check this matches the `nonce` value in the ID token.
1. Check the ID token is between the `auth_time` claim value (when the token was issued) and the `exp` claim value. If your ID token is outside this time window, you’ll need to request re-authentication from your user.

### Error handling for ‘Make a token request’

To understand more about what the error is, you can look in the response. Depending on the type of error you receive, the response may contain an `error` and an `error_description` which will provide you with information.

If the token request is invalid or unauthorised, you’ll receive an error response with the `Content-Type` of application/json, for example:

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "error": "invalid_request"
  "error_description": "invalid scope"
}
```

| Error                    | More information about your error     |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `invalid_request`        | The request is missing a parameter so the server cannot proceed with the request. This error may also be returned if the request includes an unsupported parameter or repeats a parameter.<br><br>Review your parameters and check they are supported and not repeated. |
| `invalid_client`         | Client authentication failed, which could be caused by the request containing an invalid `client_id` or an issue in validating the signature of the `client_assertion`. <br><br>To resolve, check:<br><ul><li>your `client_id` matches the `client_id` you received when you [registered your service to use GOV.UK One Login][integrate.register-your-service]</li><li>you have signed your `client_assertion` JWT with the private key generated when you [registered your service to use GOV.UK One Login][integrate.register-your-service]</li><li>your service uses a [key signing algorithm which GOV.UK One Login supports](https://oidc.account.gov.uk/.well-known/openid-configuration) |
| `invalid_grant`          | The authorisation code is invalid or expired. This is also the error which would return if the redirect URL given in the authorisation request does not match the URL provided in this access token request. |
| `unauthorized_client`    | The application is successfully authenticated, but it's not registered to use the requested [grant type](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/). |
| `unsupported_grant_type` | The grant type is not supported by the server. |

### Use your refresh token to request a new access token

A GOV.UK One Login access token is valid for 3 minutes. After 3 minutes, you cannot use an access token to make a call to `/userinfo`.

If you want to access the `/userinfo` endpoint for longer than 3 minutes, you should use a [refresh token](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#RefreshTokens) to refresh your access token.

Using a refresh token is optional. To use a refresh token, you’ll need to include the `offline_access` scope. You can read more about scopes in [choosing which user attributes your service can request][integrate.choose-user-attributes].

A refresh token lasts longer than an access token. You can find the refresh token’s lifespan in the refresh token’s claims.

To generate your refresh token, you need to make a request to the `/token` endpoint. In your request, you need to:

1. Fill in the parameters the same way as when you [made a `POST` request to the `/token` endpoint for your access token](/integrate-with-integration-environment/authenticate-your-user/#make-a-post-request-to-the-token-endpoint).
2. Leave `grant_type` as `refresh_token`.

```
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: oidc.integration.account.gov.uk
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=refresh_token
&refresh_token=i6mapTIAVSp2oJkgUnCACKKfZxt_H5MBLiqcybBBd04
```

<%= warning_text('This code example uses formatting that makes it easier to read.

#### Receive response for ‘Make a refresh token request’

If your token request is successful, the `/token` endpoint will return a response similar to this example:


```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "access_token": "SlAUH9V32hkKG",
  "refresh_token": "nJ8tfWD",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 180
}
```

| `unauthorized_client`    | The application is successfully authenticated, but it's not registered to use the requested [grant type](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/). |
| `unsupported_grant_type` | The grant type is not supported by the server. |

## Retrieve user information

You can retrieve information about your users by making a request to the `/userinfo` endpoint.

Make the request to the `/userinfo` endpoint using the access token you received when making a token request.
Using the authorisation header field, send the access token as a [bearer token](https://oauth.net/2/bearer-tokens/).
You’ll receive a JSON object which contains a collection of name and value pairs.

An example request to the `/userinfo` endpoint would look similar to this example:

```
GET /userinfo HTTP/1.1
Host: oidc.integration.account.gov.uk
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

### Receive response for ‘Retrieve user information’

The response you’ll get after making a request to the `/userinfo` endpoint will be a JSON object containing user attributes.

If you included all the scopes when you were [choosing which user attributes your service can request][integrate.choose-user-attributes] and made a request to the `/userinfo` endpoint, the response would look similar to this:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "sub": "b2d2d115-1d7e-4579-b9d6-f8e84f4f56ca",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "email_verified": true,
  "phone_number": "01406946277",
  "phone_number_verified": true,
  "updated_at":1311280970
}
```

If you included a [level of identity confidence][integrate.choose-level-of-confidence] when you made a request to the `/userinfo` endpoint, you’ll also see identity attributes in the response. You can read more about [how to prove your user's identity](../prove-users-identity/).

### Error handling for ‘Retrieve user information’

To understand more about what the error is, you can look in the response. Depending on the type of error you receive, the response may contain an `error` and an `error_description` which will provide you with information.

When a request fails, the `/userinfo` endpoint will respond with:

* an HTTP status code (usually 401 or 403)
* an error code (usually error parameter and an error description) included in the response

An error response for the `/userinfo` endpoint would look similar to this example:

```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="invalid_token",
error_description="The Access Token expired"
```

| Error           | More information about your error    |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| `invalid_token` | GOV.UK One Login denied your request as you have an invalid or missing bearer access token.<br><br>To proceed, you must use the authorisation header field to send the token as a [bearer token][external.bearer-token]. |

Once you’ve authenticated your user, you can continue with [proving your user’s identity][integrate.identity-proving]. 

If you’re only authenticating your users, skip the next section and continue to [log your users out of GOV.UK One Login][integrate.log-users-out].
