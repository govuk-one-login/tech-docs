# Build mocks to work with GOV.UK One Login

Once you’ve integrated your service with Authorization Code Flow, you can build your mocks to work with GOV.UK One Login.
This page describes:

- what to do [before you start](#before-you-start) to build mocks
- how to [set up your local development environment](/test-your-integration/build-mocks/#set-up-your-local-development-environment)
- how to [build mocks for the GOV.UK One Login integration environment endpoints](#build-your-mocks)

## Before you start


Before you can build mocks, make sure you have completed the following steps. This confirms your service is connected with GOV.UK One Login’s integration environment.


1. [Created a key pair](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/before-integrating/generate-a-key/).
1. [Registered with GOV.UK One Login](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/before-integrating/set-up-your-service-s-configuration/#register-your-service-to-use-gov-uk-one-login).
1. Configured your client ID and private key into your application so your application can create the OpenID Connect (OIDC) requests.
1. Check your application can call all GOV.UK One Login endpoints (`https://oidc.integration.account.gov.uk/.well-known/openid-configuration`, `/authorize`, `/token`, `/userinfo`, `/logout`).
If you need to log in to the integration environment, use the user ID and password issued to you by email when you registered your service. 


## Set up your local development environment


To set up your local development environment, you can do one or both of these options, depending on your development needs: 


* configure your application to use GOV.UK One Login’s integration environment – there’s further guidance on [integrating with GOV.UK One Login’s integration environment](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/integrate-with-integration-environment/)
* mock out your calls to the endpoints to provide responses without having to call external systems


## Access example data  

You can [access example data](https://github.com/govuk-one-login/rp-reference/tree/main/example-data) to help you with building your mocks. 


## Build your mocks


### Build mock for `/authorize` endpoint


You should build a mock for the `/authorize` endpoint using: 


* the request to the `/authorize` endpoint, depending on whether you’re making a [request for authentication only](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/integrate-with-integration-environment/authenticate-your-user/#make-a-request-for-authentication) or a [request for authentication and identity](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/integrate-with-integration-environment/authenticate-your-user/#make-a-request-for-authentication-and-identity)
* the [error handling for `/authorize` response](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/integrate-with-integration-environment/authenticate-your-user/#error-handling-for-make-a-request-to-the-authorize-endpoint)


### Build mock for `/token` endpoint


You should build a mock for the `/token` endpoint using: 


* the [`/token` endpoint request](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/integrate-with-integration-environment/authenticate-your-user/#make-a-post-request-to-the-token-endpoint)
* the [error handling for `/token` response](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/integrate-with-integration-environment/authenticate-your-user/#error-handling-for-make-a-token-request)


### Build mock for `/userinfo` endpoint


You should build a mock for the `/userinfo` endpoint using: 


* the [`/userinfo` endpoint request](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/integrate-with-integration-environment/authenticate-your-user/#retrieve-user-information)
* the [error handling for `/userinfo` response](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/integrate-with-integration-environment/authenticate-your-user/#error-handling-for-retrieve-user-information)

### Build mock for `/logout` endpoint


You should build a mock for the `/logout` endpoint using: 


* the [`/logout` endpoint request](/integrate-with-integration-environment/managing-your-users-sessions/#log-your-user-out-of-gov-uk-one-login)

### Build mock for the discovery endpoint


You should build a mock for the [discovery endpoint](https://oidc.integration.account.gov.uk/.well-known/openid-configuration). You can view the endpoint at `https://oidc.integration.account.gov.uk/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
