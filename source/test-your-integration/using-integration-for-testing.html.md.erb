# Using the integration environment for end-to-end testing


You can use our integration environment to test your end-to-end user journeys. 


This page describes:


* what to do [before you begin testing](/test-your-integration/using-integration-for-testing/#before-you-begin)
* how to [navigate automated testing](/test-your-integration/using-integration-for-testing/#navigating-automated-testing)
* how to [conduct end-to-end tests against the integration environment](/test-your-integration/using-integration-for-testing/#conducting-end-to-end-user-testing-against-the-integration-environment)
* how to [navigate internal performance testing of your service](/test-your-integration/using-integration-for-testing/#navigating-internal-performance-testing-of-your-service)


<%= warning_text('You must not conduct any security testing, penetration testing, performance testing, or IT health checks of the GDS estate. You must also not use personal identifiable information (PII) – GOV.UK One Login will provide example data.') %>


You should focus on end-to-end testing the critical paths, for example testing a successful identity journey. There's further guidance on how to [conduct end-to-end tests against the integration environment](/test-your-integration/using-integration-for-testing/#conducting-end-to-end-user-testing-against-the-integration-environment).


We will notify you for any changes made to the GOV.UK One Login API.


We will not notify you for changes that are internal to the GOV.UK One Login journey, for example, if the wording on a button changes.

## Before you begin


Before you can test on our integration environment, you must:


* have [registered your service to use GOV.UK One Login][integrate.register-your-service]
* have built an application to work with GOV.UK One Login
* have accessed the [example responses from the GOV.UK One Login API](https://github.com/govuk-one-login/onboarding-examples/tree/main/data)
* have contacted GOV.UK One Login to access the fictional users and their knowledge-based verification (KBV) answers to help you test your journeys


## Navigating automated testing 


GOV.UK One Login does not provide specific recommendations about automated testing. This is because we are making frequent updates to the code and user flows that may break your tests. 


However, if you choose to do automated testing, you might need to generate a one-time code using a scripting language. 


### Generate a one-time code using a scripting language


When conducting automated testing, the multi-factor authentication may block your automated tests. You can generate a one-time code using a scripting language to help your automated tests run as expected. 


1. Go to your service start page. 
1. Select **Start**. 
1. Select **Create a GOV.UK One Login**.
1. Follow the instructions to create an account using the test user data. You should use an email address which you have access to so you can receive the two-factor authentication code – if using Gmail, you can add ‘+1’ onto the end of your email address to create additional accounts, if needed. For example, `janedoe+1234@example.com`. If you are using another email provider, you might not be able to access this feature. 
1. Enter the 6-digit security code sent to your email – it will have a subject line similar to ‘Your security code for your GOV.UK One Login’.
1. Create a password. 
1. Select **Authenticator app for smartphone, tablet or computer**. 
1. Select the **I cannot scan the QR code** dropdown.
1. Make a note of the secret key which appears in the dropdown – some authenticator apps call the secret key a ‘code’.
1. Use this secret key to generate a one-time code using a scripting language within your test – there’s an [example of how to generate a one-time code using TypeScript](https://github.com/govuk-one-login/onboarding-examples/blob/main/tools/totp/totp.ts) in our GitHub repo. 

## Conducting end-to-end user testing against the integration environment
### Test successful user journeys


Before you can test successful authentication or identity proving journeys, you need to: 


1. Check you can connect to the integration environment.
1. [Contact GOV.UK One Login to access test user data](mailto:govuk-one-login@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) – you’ll use this to test your journeys.


#### Test a successful authentication journey


You should test if you can authenticate users successfully. This scenario uses a web-based journey to create a GOV.UK One Login. 


1. Go to your service start page. 
1. Select **Start**. 
1. Select **Create a GOV.UK One Login**.
1. Follow the instructions to create an account using the test user data. You should use an email address which you have access to so you can receive the two-factor authentication code – if using Gmail, you can add ‘+1’ onto the end of your email address to create additional accounts, if needed. For example, `janedoe+1234@example.com`. If you are using another email provider, you might not be able to access this feature. 
1. Enter the 6-digit security code sent to your email – it will have a subject line similar to ‘Your security code for your GOV.UK One Login’.
1. Create a password.
1. Select how you want to receive your security codes. 
1. Select **Continue**. 

#### Test a successful identity proving journey 


If your service provides identity proving functionality, you should test if you can prove your users’ identities successfully. This scenario uses a web-based journey to create a GOV.UK One Login. 


1. Go to your service start page. 
1. Select **Start**. 
1. Select **Create a GOV.UK One Login**.
1. Follow the instructions to create an account using the test user data. You should use an email address which you have access to so you can receive the two-factor authentication code – if using Gmail, you can add ‘+1’ onto the end of your email address to create additional accounts, if needed. For example, `janedoe+1234@example.com`. If you are using another email provider, you might not be able to access this feature. 
1. Enter the 6-digit security code sent to your email – it will have a subject line similar to ‘Your security code for your GOV.UK One Login’.
1. Create a password.
1. Select how you want to receive your security codes. 
1. Select **Continue**. 
1. Select **Continue** when asked about proving your identity with GOV.UK One Login.
1. Select **Yes**, then **Continue** when asked if you have a photo ID.
1. Select **Yes, I am on a computer or tablet**, then **Continue**.
1. Select **I don’t have either of these** when asked if you have a smartphone.
1. Select **UK photocard driving licence** or **UK passport** when asked if you want to use your UK photocard driving licence or UK passport to prove your identity, then **Continue**. 
1. Fill in the document details from the test user data profiles, then **Continue**.
1. Enter the postcode from the test user data profiles. 
1. Select **Find address**.
1. Find the correct address from the dropdown list and select **Choose address**.
1. Enter the correct year from the test user data profiles into **When did you start living here**, then **Continue**.
1. Select **I confirm my details are correct** then **Continue**.
1. Select **Continue**, and answer the security question from the test user data profiles (this will be in the knowledge-based verification question section in the test user data profiles document). You must answer 3 correctly and can only get a maximum of 1 wrong. 
1. Select **Continue**. 

### Test unsuccessful user journeys  


You should test if your service recognises failed authentication or identity proving journeys. Before you can test these, you need to:  


1. Check you can connect to the integration environment.
1. [Contact GOV.UK One Login to access test user data](mailto:govuk-one-login@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) – you’ll use this to test your journeys.


To test a failed journey, you need to input incorrect data. For example, inputting an incorrect date of birth, or document number.

#### Test a failed identity proving journey


If your service provides identity proving functionality, you should test a failed identity proving journey. 


Your test outcome will vary depending on whether you use the return code claim or not. 


##### Test a failed identity proving journey without the return code claim 


1. Go to your service start page. 
1. Select **Start**. 
1. Select **Create a GOV.UK One Login**.
1. Follow the instructions to create an account using the test user data. You should use an email address which you have access to so you can receive the two-factor authentication code – if using Gmail, you can add ‘+1’ onto the end of your email address to create additional accounts, if needed. For example, `janedoe+1234@example.com`. If you are using another email provider, you might not be able to access this feature.
1. Enter the 6-digit security code sent to your email – it will have a subject line similar to ‘Your security code for your GOV.UK One Login’.
1. Create a password.
1. Select how you want to receive your security codes, then **Continue**. 
1. Select **Continue** when asked about proving your identity with GOV.UK One Login.
1. Select **Yes**, then **Continue** when asked if you have a photo ID.
1. Select **Yes, I am on a computer or tablet**, then **Continue**.
1. Select **I don’t have either of these** when asked if you have a smartphone.
1. Select **UK photocard driving licence** or **UK passport** when asked if you want to use your UK photocard driving licence or UK passport to prove your identity, then **Continue**. 
1. Fill in the document details from the test user data profiles but input incorrect data – for example, an incorrect date of birth, or document number, then **Continue**.
1. When you see the error message ‘Sorry, you’ll need to prove your identity another way’, select **Prove your identity another way**.
1. Select **Continue** and you’ll receive an OAuth ‘Access Denied’ error to your `redirect_uri`.

##### Test a failed identity proving journey using the return code claim 


If you’re using the [return code claim](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/integrate-with-integration-environment/prove-users-identity/#understand-your-user-s-return-code-claim), you should test different ways of how an identity proving journey might fail. Your integration should receive the expected return code back, and handle it appropriately.


For example, submitting an incorrect document number will return an error which explains it was not possible to confirm a user’s identity.


1. Go to your service start page. 
1. Select **Start**. 
1. Select **Create a GOV.UK One Login**.
1. Follow the instructions to create an account using the test user data. You should use an email address which you have access to so you can receive the two-factor authentication code – if using Gmail, you can add ‘+1’ onto the end of your email address to create additional accounts, if needed. For example, `janedoe+1234@example.com`. If you are using another email provider, you might not be able to access this feature.
1. Enter the 6-digit security code sent to your email – it will have a subject line similar to ‘Your security code for your GOV.UK One Login’.
1. Create a password.
1. Select how you want to receive your security codes, then **Continue**. 
1. Select **Continue** when asked about proving your identity with GOV.UK One Login.
1. Select **Yes**, then **Continue** when asked if you have a photo ID.
1. Select **Yes, I am on a computer or tablet**, then **Continue**.
1. Select **I don’t have either of these** when asked if you have a smartphone.
1. Select **UK photocard driving licence** or **UK passport** when asked if you want to use your UK photocard driving licence or UK passport to prove your identity, then **Continue**. 
1. Fill in the document details from the test user data profiles but input incorrect data – for example, an incorrect date of birth, or document number, then **Continue**.
1. When you see the error message ‘Sorry, you’ll need to prove your identity another way’, select **Prove your identity another way**.
1. Select **Continue** and you’ll receive a `returnCode` in your response from `/userinfo` – there’s further [guidance on return codes](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/integrate-with-integration-environment/prove-users-identity/#understand-your-user-s-return-code-claim). 

## Navigating internal performance testing of your service 


For performance testing, you should ​​focus on the processing and successful handling of the agreed request and response volumes back into your service.


You are responsible for conducting performance testing against your own system. You should [use the GOV.UK One Login simulator to test your system](/test-your-integration/gov-uk-one-login-simulator/) as GOV.UK One Login does not provide environments for this. 


You must not: 

* performance test any GOV.UK One Login environment
* use any GOV.UK One Login environment to do performance testing of your service

If GOV.UK One Login detects an unusual amount of requests from the same IP address, you may see errors. In extreme cases, GOV.UK One Login may block your IP address. 


GOV.UK One Login is responsible for performance testing the agreed volumes of requests into the GOV.UK One Login service.


## Avoid penetration testing 


You must not do any penetration ‘pen’ testing against GOV.UK One Login’s environment.
