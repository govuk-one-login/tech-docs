# Before you integrate with the GOV.UK One Login Signal Exchange 

Before you integrate with the GOV.UK One Login Signals Exchange, you must decide on:

* A value to be used as part of the [audience](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3) claim in the [Security Event Token][external.security-event-token] (SET).
* What signal(s) you would like to receive - the GOV.UK One Login Signal Exchange team can help you with this.
* Your [expected throughput][ssfOut.signal-delivery] of users to use GOV.UK One Login.
* A support process in case we need to contact you.

As a minimum, you should be able to provide a value for the `audience` claim so that we can provide a `clientId` and `clientSecret` that you can use for authenticating against the GOV.UK One Login Signals Exchange Transmitter API. 

You must also set up:

* An [OAuth2 service][ssfOut.oauth2] that supports the [ OAuth2 Client Credential Grant][external.oauth-client-credentials-flow].  
* A [receiver service][ssfOut.receiver] that can receive signals sent by the GOV.UK One Login Transmitter.

You should also:

* Set up a health check using the [verification endpoint][ssfOut.health].

You can:

* [View your configuration][ssfOut.configuration].
