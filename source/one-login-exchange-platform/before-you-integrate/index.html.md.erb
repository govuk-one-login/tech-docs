# Before you integrate with the GOV.UK One Login Signal Exchange platform 

Before you integrate with the GOV.UK One Login Signals Exchange Platform, you must decide on

* A value to be used as part of the [audience](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3) claim in the [Security Event Token][external.security-event-token] (SET)
* What signals you would like to receive
* Your [expected throughput][ssfOut.event-delivery] of users attempting to use GOV.UK One Login.
* A support process in case we need to contact you in regards to any errors.

As a minimum, you should be able to provide a value for the audience claim so that we can provide a `clientId` and `clientSecret` to use for authenticating against the GOV.UK One Login Signals Exchange Platform Transmitter API. 

You must also setup

* An [OAuth2 service][ssfOut.oauth2] that supports the [Client Credential Grant][external.oauth-client-credentials-flow]  
* A [receiver service][ssfOut.receiver] that can receive signals sent by the GOV.UK One Login Transmitter.

You should also

* setup a health check using the [verification endpoint][ssfOut.health]

You can

* [view your configuration][ssfOut.configuration]
