# Perform a Health check

The health check uses the [Verification Endpoint][external.ssfOut-verfication-endpoint] as a way to confirm the connection between the GOV.UK One Login Transmitter and your receiver as well as a way to test your [receiver][ssfOut.receiver].

In order to send a health check, you must first authenticate against the GOV.UK One Login Transmitter OAuth token endpoint:

<%= partial "partials/ssf_out_transmitter-token-endpoint" %>

Once you've obtained an `ACCESS_TOKEN` you can then send a `POST` request to the verification endpoint: 

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url VERIFIFCATION_ENDPOINT \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data PAYLOAD
```

Where the optional `PAYLOAD` field is the following JSON object converted to a JSON string:

```json
{
  "state": "abc123"
}
```

Below are the verfication endpoints for our: 

- [Integration][external.ssfOut-verify-endpoint-int] Environment.
- [Production][external.ssfOut-verify-endpoint-prod] Environment.


Once the request is made, the value of `state` will be included in the verification signal to your receiver endpoint if supplied. The value of `state` must be: 

* Any alphanumeric character.
* Maximum length of 64 characters.

You can also [view your configuration][ssfOut.configuration].
