# Receiver Endpoint

The receiver endpoint is where the GOV.UK One Login Transmitter will send signals related to user activity. 

After obtaining an `ACCESS_TOKEN` from the [OAuth Token Endpoint][ssfOut.oauth2], the transmitter will make the following request when attempting to send the signal:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://your.service.gov.uk/receiver \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/secevent+jwt' \
  --data SIGNAL
```

`SIGNAL` is a [Security Event Token][external.security-event-token] (SET) which builds upon the [JSON Web Token (JWT)][external.jwt-rfc] format and can be decoded as a regular JWT. You must return a `HTTP 202 (Accepted)` within 10 seconds of the `POST` request. Any other responses will be treated as an error and will be attempted to be [delivered again][ssfOut.signal-delivery].

## Signature Verfication

As part of the SET, there is a signature that should be used to verify the authenticity of the payload:

1. Validate that the SET `kid` claim exists in the JWKS (JSON web key set) returned by the `/jwks` endpoint.
1. Check the JWT `alg` header matches the value for the key you are using. 
1. Use the key to validate the signature on the logout token according to the [JSON Web Signature Specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515).
1. Check the value of `iss` (issuer) matches `https://ssf.account.gov.uk/`.
1. Check the `aud` (audience) claim is the same client ID you received when you [registered your service to use GOV.UK One Login Signal Exchange Platform][ssfOut.before-you-integrate].
1. Check the `iat` (issued at) claim is in the past.


Below are the JWKS endpoints for our: 

- [Integration][external.ssfOut-jwks-endpoint-int] Environment.
- [Production][external.ssfOut-jwks-endpoint-prod] Environment.

As we may send SETs at a [high throughput][ssfOut.signal-delivery], you must implement caching of the JWKS endpoint. The cache must:

* Refresh regularly. 
* Refresh if the value in the `kid` claim does not exist in your cache.

## Signal Delivery

A single user interaction with GOV.UK One Login may generate several signals therfore it is important that you configure your receiver endpoint be setup to support a high throughput. We recommend that your receiver endpoint is setup to support a minimum of 100 signals per second. 

The GOV.UK One Login Signal Exchange Platform will work with you identify the expected delivery rate of signals based on a number of factors, as well as implement rate limiting to prevent your infrastructure from being overwhelmed with signals. These factors include:

* Your expected throughput of users attempting to use GOV.UK One Login.
* The Signals that you have subscribed to.
* If you are strictly an Auth only service or if you are a Identity Proofing and Verification Service.

### Transmitter Assumptions

You should also assume that the GOV.UK One Login Transmitter may deliver:

* Signals out of order.
* Duplicate signals.

GOV.UK One Login Transmitter will make a best effort attempt to ensure that signals are delivered in order and that there is no duplication.

### Transmitter Error Handling

If the transmitter receives any response other than `HTTP 202 (Accepted)`, then it is considered an error. The transmitter may attempt redelivery every 30 seconds upto 5 times. After the 5th attempt, the failed signals may be kept for upto 14 days before they are discarded. The failed signals may be redelivered upon request.

Once you have set up your transmitter, you may test the integration by either:

* Setting up a [health check][ssfOut.health].
* Testing in the GOV.UK One Login [integration evironment][ssfOut.integration-testing].
