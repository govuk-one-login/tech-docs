# OAuth Token Endpoint

GOV.UK One Login Signal Exchange platform uses the [OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow][external.oauth-client-credentials-flow] to authenticate between One Login and your service when sending events.

GOV.UK One Login Transmitter will initiate the client credentials flow by making this API request  

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://YOUR.SERVICE.gov.uk/oauth/token \
  --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data client_id=CLIENT_ID \
  --data client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET \
  --data grant_type=client_credentials
```
The expected response should look like the following

```json
{
  "access_token": "QGbWG8KckncuwwD4uYXgWxF4HQvuPmrmUqKgkpQP",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 14400,
  "scope": "hello"
}
```

## Token Endpoint behaviour

There are certain assumptions that we make about your endpoint. These are

* Validity of `access_token`
    * GOV.UK must be able to request a new token without invalidating previously issued tokens
    * The token must be valid for a minimum of 1 hour
* Throughput
    * The `/token` endpoint will need to be able to support a high throughput[link to throughput section]

The token endpoint should then be used to protect the [receiver endpoint][ssfOut.receiver]
