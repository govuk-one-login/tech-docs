# Configuring for production

Configuring for production is similar to the [integration evironment][ssfOut.integration-testing]. First getting in touch with your engagement manager to say that you're ready to integrate in production. We will then perform a health check to establish a connectivity test our production environment and your production receiver. 

We will perform then perform some additional changes to the Signal Exchange Platform to enable the delivery of the signals that have been agreed upon.

Once all the changes are made, any user that goes through your production environment will generate signal and will be delivered to your receiver. 

Once the production configurartion is complete, you can continue with [configuring your service for production][integrate.configure-for-prod]
