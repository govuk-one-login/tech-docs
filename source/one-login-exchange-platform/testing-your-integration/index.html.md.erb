# Testing your integration in Signal Exchange Platform's integration environment 

Onve you have built the necessary [services][ssfOut.before-you-integrate], you can start testing your integration with GOV.UK One Login and the Signal Exchange Platform

To get started, first get in touch with your Engagement Manager, they will work with you and the Signal Exchange Platform to perform a [health check][ssfOut.health]. By performing a health check, we are establishing a connectivity test between the Signal Exchange Platform's integration environment and your receiver.

Once the health check is complete, the rest of the integration requirements will need to be [addressed][ssfOut.before-you-integrate] and some additional changes will be made to enable the delivery of the signals.

Once the changes are complete, you can contintue with your [integration][integrate.integrate] with GOV.UK One Login and begin [testing][integrate.test-connection] your integration with GOV.UK One Login as normal. 

As you interact with One Login's integration environment, signals will be generated and delivered to your receiver.

After testing is complete, you can move towards [Configuring your service for Production][ssfOut.production]
