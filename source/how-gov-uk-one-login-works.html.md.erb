# How GOV.UK One Login works

GOV.UK One Login is an [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/connect/)-compliant service that helps you authenticate your users who are using services they’ve logged into with their GOV.UK One Login.

GOV.UK One Login uses 2 different environments:

* an integration environment, which contains sample users and data for you to test your service’s integration with GOV.UK One Login
* a production environment, which is the live environment for real users to access and use your service’s integration with GOV.UK One Login

## Understand the flow GOV.UK One Login uses

1. Your service asks the user to sign in or create an account.
1. If your service needs confidence your user is who they say they are, GOV.UK One Login will request proof of identity.
1. GOV.UK One Login collects evidence of the user’s identity.
1. GOV.UK One Login provides information about your user.

To understand the technical flow, for example the endpoints, requests and tokens, there's a more detailed technical diagram you can use.

1. Your service makes an [authorisation request][integrate.make-authorize-request] to the `/authorize` endpoint.
1. The user logs in (or creates an account if they do not have one) and proves their identity if your service needs them to. GOV.UK One Login lets your user know how their data will be shared with your service.
1. GOV.UK One Login returns an [authorisation code][integrate.generate-auth-code] to your service.
1. Your service makes a [token request][integrate.make-token-request] to the `/token` endpoint and includes the authorisation code in the request.
1. Your service receives an [ID token and access token][integrate.receive-tokens] in the response.
1. Your service makes a request to the `/userinfo` endpoint to [retrieve user information][integrate.retrieve-user-info]. You can read more about [choosing which user attributes your service can request][integrate.choose-user-attributes].
1. Your service receives a [response containing user attributes][integrate.user-info-response].
1. Your service makes a [log out request][integrate.make-logout-request] to the `/logout` endpoint and includes the optional `id_token_hint`.
1. Your service receives an `HTTP 302` response redirecting the user to the `post_logout_redirect_uri`.
